    "* Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression methods. Like Lasso Regression, it introduces a penalty term to the cost function that can perform feature selection and shrink some coefficients to zero. Like Ridge Regression, it introduces a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients of correlated variables towards each other to reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elastic Net Regression differs from Lasso and Ridge Regression in that it allows for a mix of the L1 and L2 penalty terms, controlled by a parameter called the mixing parameter, which balances the strengths of the two penalties. When the mixing parameter is set to 0, Elastic Net Regression is equivalent to Ridge Regression, and when it is set to 1, it is equivalent to Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful when there are a large number of variables, some of which may be correlated, and when there is a need for feature selection and multicollinearity reduction. It can provide a more flexible and balanced approach to regularization than Lasso or Ridge Regression alone"
